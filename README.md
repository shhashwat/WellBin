WELLBIN - Smart City Solutions for clean living and health monitoring

Every day, several lives in India are impacted due to delayed patient care at emergency. Moreover, real-time parameter values are not promptly measured at the place and it gets delayed to reach to doctors via clinics and hospitals. It is also difficult for hospitals to continuously monitor the health of all their patients. It is also not feasible to regulate the hygiene of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients due to the different need of each patient. Proposed project WELLBIN is useful in managing both situations. Proposed project WELLBIN is intended to be utilised in hospitals for the purpose of measuring and keeping track of several characteristics, such as heart rate, temperature and hygiene. Additionally, the data can be sent to the cellular device using a Global System for Mobile- communication (GSM) module. The objective of this project WELLBIN is to build Smart City Solutions for public health monitoring and encourage clean living in metropolitan cities. There are two main sections of this project: First is Health Monitoring of patient and sending data to doctor in case of emergency. Second is Hygiene and clean living of patient at ICU, hospital, home through a smart garbage monitoring system.


SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDG)
This project is correlated with SDG Goal 3: “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”, this project introduces a healthcare innovation utilizing Arduino Mega 2560 and GSM modules to monitor vital stats, enabling access and well-being through digital means and preventive care measures.

This project is also correlated with SDG Goal 11: “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”, this project introduces public health management and waste management for attractive smart city solutions. Our project aims to create durable cities which enables enhancing the quality of life for urban residents.

This project is minorly correlated with SDG Goal 6: “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”, this project integrates smart garbage monitoring with addition to health parameter tracking to improve hygiene, fulfilling the objectives of clean living and sustainable sanitation in urban areas.
